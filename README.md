This is one of my first game-projects. It is a classic and simple Pong game developed using Python and the Turtle module.

Turtle module

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

`git clone https://github.com/RaresBogdan/pong-game.git`

2. Change directory into the cloned repository.

## How to Play

**For Player A :** use the W and S keys to move Paddle A up and down.
